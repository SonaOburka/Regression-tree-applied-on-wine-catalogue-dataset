Content:
- Large dataset cleaning -  Wine Catalogue Dataset - over 320.000 records - due to its extensive size the sample of 120.000 records was uploaded in GitHub
- Regression tree analysis.

The regression tree variables:
- **Wine price** - dependent variable
- **Wine category** and **country of wine production** - two independent variables. 

Four hypothese testing:
- The hypotheses on the dessert wine to be the most expensive wine category was confirmed
- The hypotheses on white wines being less expensive than red wines was also confirmed.
- The hypotheses that Italy produces the most expensive wines was confirmed only partially as it depends on the category of wine.
- The hypotheses that the regression tree model was more complex than regression tree model from reduced dataset was not confirmed.
